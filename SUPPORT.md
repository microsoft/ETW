## How to file issues and get help

For help and questions about ETW, please look at the [docs site for ETW][docs] and our [Contributor's Guide][contributor] if you want to contribute to the ETW Repository.

This project uses [GitHub issues][gh-issue] to [track bugs][gh-bug] and [feature requests][gh-feature]. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new topics, file your bug or feature request as a new issue.
